# OpenTelemetry auto-instrumentation extension

[![Build and test](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-php-instrumentation/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-php-instrumentation/actions/workflows/build.yml)

This is a PHP extension for OpenTelemetry, to enable auto-instrumentation.
It is based on [zend_observer](https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/engineering/php-8-observability-baked-right-in/) and requires php8+

The extension allows creating `pre` and `post` hook functions to arbitrary PHP functions and methods, which allows those methods to be wrapped with telemetry. 

## Requirements
- PHP 8+
- [OpenTelemetry PHP library](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-php)

## Installation

The extension can be installed in all of the usual ways:

### pecl

```shell
pecl install opentelemetry
```
### pickle

[pickle](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/pickle) can be used to install extensions that are available via http://pecl.php.net, or install directly from source code.

To install directly from source code:
```shell
php pickle.phar install --source https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-php-instrumentation.git#1.0.0beta1
```

### php-extension-installer

If you are using the [official PHP docker images](https://hub.docker.com/_/php) then you can use
[php-extension-installer](https://github.com/mlocati/docker-php-extension-installer)

From github:
```shell
install-php-extensions open-telemetry/opentelemetry-php-instrumentation@main
```

Via pecl/pickle:
```shell
install-php-extensions opentelemetry[-beta|-stable|-latest]
```

## Verify that the extension is installed and enabled

```shell
php -m | grep  opentelemetry
```

## Usage

The following example adds an observer to the `DemoClass::run` method, and provides two functions which will be run before and after the method call.

The `pre` method starts and activates a span. The `post` method ends the span after the observed method has finished.

#### Warning
Be aware of that, trivial functions are candidates for optimizations.
Optimizer can optimize them out and replace user function call with more optimal set of instructions (inlining).
In this case hooks will not be invoked as there will be no function.


```php
<?php

$tracer = new Tracer(...);

OpenTelemetry\Instrumentation\hook(
    DemoClass::class,
    'run',
    static function (DemoClass $demo, array $params, string $class, string $function, ?string $filename, ?int $lineno) use ($tracer) {
        $span = $tracer->spanBuilder($class)
            ->startSpan();
        Context::storage()->attach($span->storeInContext(Context::getCurrent()));
    },
    static function (DemoClass $demo, array $params, $returnValue, ?Throwable $exception) use ($tracer) {
        $scope = Context::storage()->scope();
        $scope?->detach();
        $span = Span::fromContext($scope->context());
        $exception && $span->recordException($exception);
        $span->setStatus($exception ? StatusCode::STATUS_ERROR : StatusCode::STATUS_OK);
        $span->end();
    }
);
```
